# {DRAFT} Decred Journal â€“ November 2018

![{alt text}](../img/{file.jpg} "{hover text}")

November was an exciting and productive month for the Decred Project. The community began to reap the benefits of Politeia development with successful live proposal voting. Stakeholders collectively voiced key steering decisions regarding the future of contractor management, public relations, and research all from the comfort of their Decred wallet of choice (Decrediton or Command-Line w/politeiavoter).

Decred project organically prepared to scale to support stakeholder vision in November - additional companies and individuals joined the Decred ecosystem while some long term contributors self-organized according to interests and abilities.

Amidst the excitement, growth and change in the community, Decred development continued with high levels of activity and progress.

## Development

{per-project summary, drop items without updates}

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd): This month developers merged [reversed UTXO set semantics](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1471), an important change that provides simpler handling by all the Decred nodes around the world resulting improved effeciency (for example full block tests run 40% faster). A [database migration](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1520) will be added in the next major release to capitolize on the improvements after extensive testing is completed.

[dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet): As usage has increased the number of addresses watched by default has become too limited for some and configuration file modification for dcrwallet was required as a workaround. This [address watching issue](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1320) was fixed by default this month. Additional rare use case fixes included potential [missed or double spent transactions](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1321) and [improvement of locked balance calculations](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet/pull/1330).

[Decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton): To ensure continued cross-platform stability and performance Decrediton was [updated to Electron 3](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1777) this month. Display of the Decred [Treasury balance](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1777) was added. The [Decred Treasury](https://explorer.dcrdata.org/address/Dcur2mcGjmENx4DhNqDctW5wJCVyT3Qeqkx) holds the funds for use in project development. General [loading optimizations](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1825) and optimizations specific to [large wallets](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1727) were completed ensuring continued fast performace as wallets scale in size. Several ticket buying optimizations were included in the [ticketbuyer v2](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1744) and will be included in the next release of Decrediton.  Voting and proposal integration saw improvements as well including [notifications for new proposals and votes](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/pull/1835). In addition to the function and performance of Decrediton, the UI/UX saw significant tuneups this month including [general design improvements](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/1818), adjustments for readability like [resizing](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/1826) and [icons](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/1811), and improvements to the [navigation and animation](https://github.com/decred/decrediton/issues/1809).
[Trezor](https://blog.trezor.io/firmware-updates-2-0-9-and-1-7-1-developed-by-the-community-for-the-community-c4b965741ca3): On a related note, Model T firmware version 2.0.9 was [released](https://blog.trezor.io/firmware-updates-2-0-9-and-1-7-1-developed-by-the-community-for-the-community-c4b965741ca3) with Decred support. Cheers @matheusd for making it happen! Now our Decrediton developers can work on the integration.

[Politeia](https://github.com/decred/politeia): While an active month of proposals and voting was taking place on the [Politeia site](https://proposals.decred.org/) the development team was hard at work in the background making refinements, improvements, and adding features.  Refinements included [highlighting new comments](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/897), improving the [vetted proposal lookup](https://github.com/decred/politeia/pull/613) and general performance and UI updates. The community and development team collaborated to improve security by [patching a vulnerability](https://github.com/decred/politeia/issues/563), applying a [general security improvement](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/issues/917), and making privacy improvements to [politeiavoter](https://github.com/decred/politeia/tree/master/politeiavoter). By popular demand an [email notification system](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/919) was created to support awareness about comments and new proposals. Easy verifications were made possible by the [search by ticket](https://github.com/decred/politeiagui/pull/899) feature which will allow voters to verify votes cast with an independent lookup.

[Android](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid): Development of the Decred Mobile Wallet for Android a leap forward this month with an pre-release version available on the [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.decred.dcrandroid.mainnet).  The Play Store version includes updated currency conversion including [local currency for fee](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/192) when available and [advanced password protection](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/134) including the ability to [lock all data](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/187) and to use an [access pin code](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/180).  This version also includes a security menu which allows users to [sign messages](https://github.com/decred/)dcrandroid/issues/226) proving ownership of addresses. Another community sourced innovation successfully implemented is the ["Hidden Account" feature](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/175).  Hidden accounts allow mobile users to keep funds in their mobile wallet which will not be displayed on the main screen balance total.  Community members buying and selling Decred at local meetups are excited for the added privacy and security this feature offers.  Fund transfer between accounts also got an upgrade this month with simple [dropdown selection](https://github.com/decred/dcrandroid/issues/119) ensuring balance changes are quick and easy.

[iOS](https://github.com/raedahgroup/dcrios): The iOS Mobile Wallet is currently in beta testing and will require additonal development cycles to incorporate the feature set available on Android.

[dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata): Our native [goLang block explorer](https://explorer.dcrdata.org) is becoming a one-stop shop for all data Decred. New features integrated into the base code this month include a [network hashrate chart](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/723), the addition of the [Decred Treasury](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/784) and more detailed transaction information like [spent with mempool txs](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/825), [tx type on address view]{https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/741) and improved [timestamp information](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/776).  Community excitement has spurred a few additional features in [beta](https://beta.dcrdata.org) including [consensus voting results](https://beta.dcrdata.org/agendas), [xpub support](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/677), [transaction fee charts](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata/issues/671) and more. Stay tuned for further developments next month!

[dcrstakepool](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool): The secure open source dcrstakepool package and recommended setup architecture helps ensure that Decred stakepools run with high effeciency.  The recent [README.md](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/blob/master/README.md) improvement in the repository makes use and auditing easier than ever. This month various inititives to improve privacy and security began including replacement of 3rd party reCAPTCHA with a [self-hosted "no fingerprinting" CAPTCHA system](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/281), a [self-hosted charting liberary](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/pull/283) to avoide Cloudflare and an [revamped login system](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/issues/274) that would allow users to sign up without using email. Query and [lookup features were also redirected](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/issues/264) from the Insight Block Explorer to [dcrdata](https://explorer.dcrdata.org) Community interested in testing are invited to follow the [GitHub issue links](https://github.com/decred/dcrstakepool/issues).

[Ticket splitting](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher): The Ticket Splitting Beta continued to grow during November with split tickets filled daily.  Additional content was for ease of use was added by both the original ticket splitting VSP [decredbrasil.com](https://stake.decredbrasil.com/) and the second VSP to add ticket splitting [decredvoting.com](https://decredvoting.com/).  Content incuded a [walk-through video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RGoUQK0g24&feature=share) in Portuguese and English, a general [ticket splitting overview](https://www.reddit.com/r/decred/comments/9vhpby/decred_ticket_splitting_overview/) and guides on both VSP sites.  The ticket splitting software was updated to support using with [wallets configured for SPV](https://github.com/matheusd/dcr-split-ticket-matcher/issues/29).  Ticket splitting support groups exist both on the [Decred Slack](https://decred.slack.com) and in the [Telegram Group](https://t.me/dcrticketsplit) where [VSP agnostic instructions](https://t.me/dcrticketsplit/2666) are availble.

## Governance

{recap of decision-making activity, including new proposals, changes to proposals, voting, discussions, pre-proposal drafts, etc}

Part of November was reported in the previous issue due to late release.

@snr01 provided nice charts. Multiple people started hacking on Politeia data in #proposals and #research.

Low quality proposals cluttering Politeia were disussed in depth and multiple ideas were suggested. @richardred gave a nice overview of this in Politeia Digest #4.

## Markets

{markets overview: USD and BTC prices, highs and lows, interesting events, interesting analysis}

Nov 14-15 BTC drop, most top 100 cryptoassets lost 10-20% together with the BTC dive to 5400 USDT / 5200 USD. This happened just a day before the BCH split.

The Media [believes](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-16/crypto-winter-comes-early-as-bitcoin-slide-spurs-viability-fears) the BTC dump was sparked by some pump for Bitcoin Cash fork, citing fear, uncertainty and doubt of some guys.

Nov 19-20 bloody day, BTC down to $4300 {right?}, DCR down to $22.

## Relevant External

{PoW, ASIC resistance, tech}

Nvidia [reported](https://cointelegraph.com/news/nvidia-q3-results-reveal-crypto-hangover-due-to-disappearance-of-miner-sales) a drop in GPU sales for mining. This must have nothing to do with Ethereum, Zcash and others receiving ASICs for their GPU-oriented mining algorithms, but rather "it is really the canary in the coal mine for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies" per [the experts](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-16/crypto-winter-comes-early-as-bitcoin-slide-spurs-viability-fears). Seriously guys, it is the [collapse](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-15/nvidia-gives-weak-forecast-citing-inventory-stock-slumps) of cryptocurrency mining.

Ethereum Foundation is funding [efforts](https://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-foundation-filecoin-back-plan-to-make-proof-of-stake-hardware) to create ASICs that compute [Verifiable Delay Function](https://vdfresearch.org/) (VDF) as a replacement for Proof-of-Work mining for blockchain security. [This article](https://medium.com/@djrtwo/vdfs-are-not-proof-of-work-91ba3bec2bf4) compares VDF and Proof-of-Work.

Zcash [approved](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/GrantProposals-2018Q2/issues/15#issuecomment-436106276) funding of ProgPoW prototype for Zcash. This ASIC-resistant, GPU-friendly algorithm that was also [proposed](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/0aaab331075d08cb03333d5a1bef04b99a708dcbfebc8f8c94040ceb1676e684) in Politeia recently.

{BCH Rust impl https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-cash-community-introduced-to-new-bch-library-written-in-rust/}

According to [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9sq0jj/shady_behavior_from_groestlcoin_grs_developers/), yet another coin with claimed ASIC resistance received an ASIC while the developers removed ASIC resistance claims from the website. Reddit thread that questioned this was [wiped out](https://archive.today/SzoHs). An instance where transparent censorship is missing. (_missed in Oct issue_)

A paper was [published](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0321-8) in Nature Climate journal that suggests Bitcoin PoW mining will have significant negative impact on climate change. [Discussion](https://matrix.to/#/!NKtIRqGOEGaZvSQkKl:decred.org/$15412120277994HzToF:decred.org) in #random noted serious misunderstandings of how PoW works and alarmingly low quality of the paper, along with some guesses who and why could post it.

Zcash is [looking into](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/announcing-zcash-blossom-and-proposed-feature-goals/31891) hybrid ASIC-GPU mining, among other improvements planned for next year's protocol upgrade.

RChain community's is going through [internal conflicts](https://joshyorndorff.com/blog/keeping-the-rchain-community-together). {what is the source of controversy?} This is not the first internal conflict for RChain, since it itself was born out of a disagreement inside Synereo project which has led to a split in the past. {#governance link}

Looking at many fighting in other communities I (@bee) can't help but insert a personal comment. It appears to me that communities waste a ton of energy on all the controversies. This energy is not building value. Chain splits and community splits leave both sides with less people, less talent, and less chances to make any long term impact. It is ironic that in a space of programmed decentralized consensus systems so many people fail to come to human consensus. Decred manages to keep moving at its decent speed because it avoids external, and more importantly, internal conflicts. Let us keep incentives aligned and keep the community together. {ok or move to own blog?}

UK government canceled a stablecoin project based on a fork of btcd. [@alexbosworth] [noted](https://twitter.com/alexbosworth/status/1056318062176145414): "The thing about stablecoins is that one day someone can come along and cancel the whole thing.".

> @andy_bromberg and @msantoriESQ discuss why ICOs are down 90% since the winter, why airdrops could be a better than ICOs for seeding usage on networks, whether or not they're legal and which wallets to target.

Regular security reminder: SMS, and relying on mobile operators in general, is bad choice for 2FA. Good to see lawsuits [like this](https://www.coindesk.com/victims-sue-att-t-mobile-over-sim-swap-crypto-hacks/) starting but they won't get your coins back. Speaking even more generally, most smartphones have a [baseband chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseband_processor) and other proprietary parts that nobody really knows what they are doing or how vulnerable they are. Keep your coins safe.

Copay/Bitpay got hacked, if you used this wallet or its derivative, you may need to move your coins to a new seed. The cause was repository compromise of one of its NPM dependencies. Details here:

* Decred software was not affected by this hack.
