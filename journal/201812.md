# {DRAFT} Decred Journal â€“ December 2018

![{alt text}](../img/{file.jpg} "{hover text}")

{introduction, major news of the month}

## Development

{per-project summary, drop items without updates}

Unless there is a binary release, new features and bugfixes are available on the master branches of the projects. This means they passed review from multiple developers and can be built from source by developers and enthusiasts, but there are no end user installers until the next release.

For web based projects like Politeia and dcrdata, new merged work is usually available after the deployment which happens several days later. {keep or revert to per-project notice?}

[dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd):

* Smart fee estimator finally [merged](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1434) that allows to either minimize mining delay or the fee rate, depending on what user needs. The feature is explained in detail in its [issue](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/issues/1412).
* Module versions were bumped in preparation of v1.4.0 release https://github.com/decred/dcrd/pull/1541
